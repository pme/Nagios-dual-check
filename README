Nagios dual check

  check_dual.pl

Description:
	It is often necessary to run checks on a host with dual IP address. The
	check_dual.pl is an attempt to simplify this task. The Nagios config is allow
	us to write anything in a 'define host' 'address' directive. Let's write both
	address sperated by comma and similarly to the check_nrpe stanza, use the
	check_dual command as described below.

	define host {
		host_name		host1
		address			1.2.3.4,5.6.7.8
		check_command check_dual|check_ping|
		...
	}

	define command {
		command_name	check_dual
		command_line	/usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_dual.pl -H $HOSTADDRESS$ -c $ARG1$ "\$ARG2$ $ARG3$ $ARG4$ $ARG5$"
	}

	check_dual.pl itself contains two truth table for calculating the resulting
	state. One of those check that both of them have to be ok (eg. check_ping
	have to be ok for both ip address of the host), the other is those that one
	of them working is ok (eg. NRPE disk_check on a host is ok, even if ok via on
	of the address of the host).
